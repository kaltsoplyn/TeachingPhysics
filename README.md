# TeachingPhysics
Various notebooks for demoing/teaching var stuff in physics.

These are just Julia Jupyter notebooks to demo particular aspects of phenomena that come up in my classes
on optoelectronics and spectroscopy at the UoC.  

The incentive here is to produce appealing visuals for the students, but also to learn Julia myself.
